Classical Q-learning with curiosity + Îµ comparison
# RL Agent with Curiosity

This repository contains two classical Q-learning agents:

- âœ… `agent_with_curiosity.ipynb`: Learns with intrinsic curiosity bonus
- âœ… `epsilon_comparison.ipynb`: Ablation study comparing Îµ-decay vs constant Îµ

### ðŸ“Š Visual Results

- Reward vs Curiosity Bonus
- Agent Accuracy During Training
- Exploration Heatmap
- Îµ-Decay vs Constant-Îµ Comparison

### ðŸ§  Why It Matters

This forms the classical baseline for my research project:
> *Quantum + Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Exploration in Intelligent Agents.*

Used in my upcoming preprint.
